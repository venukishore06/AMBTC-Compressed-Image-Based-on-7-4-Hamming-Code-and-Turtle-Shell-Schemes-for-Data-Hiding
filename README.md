Upload all the images into a folder and name it as "input_images".
Create an empty folder "compressed_images" for storing all the compressed images.
Run the Project_code.py.
After running the program successfully you can see all the compressed images being stored into the "compressed_images" folder.
Run the Performance.py for getting the output in a text flie "proposed_txt" and, run the graph.py for getting a graphical representation for 1000, 512x512 greyscale test images.
The AMBTC.py, AMBTC_Hamming.py, AMBTC_turtle_shell.py are seperate codes for AMBTC, (7,4) Hamming code and Turtle Shell Matrix. You can also run these codes based on your need.
